Ruby Bundler is a RubyGem that is used for Rails 3+ and other Ruby projects to check dependencies of RubyGems for the project.

To use you can do the following:
 * :cd to a project with a Gemfile located at the root.
 * Open Gemfile
 * In Ex-command mode type <tt>:Bundle check</tt>
 * This will check your Gemfile dependencies are satisfied.  If there are RubyGem requirements specified in your Gemfile that are not satisfied the plugin will open up a quickfix window and for each error open up the Gemfile at the requirement that fails using quickfix keybindings.

Full featured quickfix support for other Bundler subcommands coming soon.  You can clone the Git repository on GitHub from here:
